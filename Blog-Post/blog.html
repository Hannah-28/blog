                    <strong><span>I'</span>ve been interested in philosophy of art for quite some time.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>There is no objective “right” or “wrong” when it comes to art.</p>
                <p>Unlike an accountant completing the math equation 2 + 2 = 4 (certainly correct), an artist does not know how the public will receive their innovative equation (ugly? beautiful?).</p>
                <p>And that uncertainty naturally affects a human being’s confidence and self-worth in business.</p>
                <p>No wonder (well-intentioned) people in your life have tried to talk you out of <a href="https://copyblogger.com/become-an-expert/"  class="reference">pursuing content marketing to build an online business.</a></p>
                <h2>Will the “real artist” please stand up?</h2>
                <p><a href="https://copyblogger.com/beat-impostor-syndrome/" class="reference">Impostor syndrome</a> prevents many artists from evolving into professional creatives.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It’s the feeling that we’re not good enough.</li>
                    <li>It’s the feeling that someone else knows what they’re doing.</li>
                    <li>It’s the feeling that criticism is just too painful.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><i>The root of impostor syndrome in creative business is the false belief that your art is not worth money because someone might not like it.</i></p>
                    <p><strong><u>And the quality that separates a recreational artist from a professional artist is that the professional feels worthy of getting paid for subjective work</u>.</strong></p>

                <p>They know their creations are not going to please everyone — and they know they deserve to be paid anyway, simply because of their high level of thought and care for their work.</p>
